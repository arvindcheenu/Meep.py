## About the Program

**MEEP** is the abbreviation for ***Mark Entry Evaluation Program***.

This python program analyses the contents of a space separated table of students and their marks under respective subjects as per the prescribed CBSE File formatting.

It also used `matplotlib` to plot pass percentage of the students in a class and to plot the average percentage of marks scored in each subject.

## Running

This program uses `python -v 2.7`, hence ensure to run the program after installing the required version of `python` from https://www.python.org/downloads/.

To install via commandline
`curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
python get-pip. py
`
Then, for the plot function to work, install matplotlib with pip:
`python -mpip install matplotlib`

Finally, to run the program, enter the command:
`python ../tkmeep.py`

where `../` must be replaced by the directory in which the python file is present.
